# CSprite
A Processing based Sprite class written in Java. Supports animated and instanced sprites.

Written in Processing while I was teaching at Digital Media Academy.

Wrote this to showcase to the students the kinds of things they could do in Processing. Eventually developed into a test of how capable the rendering in Processing is as you can spawn up to 20k sprite instances on a Macbook Pro 2016 with the Iris 530.
